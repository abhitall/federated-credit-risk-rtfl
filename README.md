# DP-RTFL: Differentially Private Resilient Temporal Federated Learning for Trustworthy AI in Regulated Industries

## TL;DR
DP-RTFL is an advanced federated learning framework ensuring training continuity, precise state recovery, and strong data privacy. It integrates local Differential Privacy with resilient temporal state management and zero-knowledge proofs, making it suitable for critical applications like credit risk assessment using sensitive financial data.

## Problem Description
Standard federated learning (FL) systems face significant challenges in operational resilience against concurrent client and server failures. Furthermore, they often lack robust, verifiable privacy guarantees essential for handling sensitive data, such as the financial details in `application_record.csv` and `credit_record.csv`. These deficiencies lead to risks of training disruption, data loss, model integrity issues, and non-compliance with data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA, financial services mandates), hindering FL adoption in mission-critical sectors like banking and healthcare.

## Proposed Solution
We propose Differentially Private Resilient Temporal Federated Learning (DP-RTFL), a framework designed for continuous, auditable, and privacy-preserving training on sensitive datasets. DP-RTFL enhances the original RTFL concept by deeply integrating local Differential Privacy (LDP) at the client level. This ensures that individual contributions to model updates are protected before aggregation, alongside the framework's inherent resilience capabilities.

## Key Innovations
- **Local Differential Privacy (LDP) Integration:**
  - Client-side application of (ε, δ)-Differential Privacy to model updates (deltas) via mechanisms like Gaussian noise addition after L2 norm clipping. This formally limits information leakage about individual data records (e.g., a single credit applicant's data), directly supporting **Regulatory Compliance**.
- **Temporal Checkpoint Manifold (TCM):**
  - A distributed, chronologically ordered log of global model states and client contributions, treated as a continuous manifold. This allows for precise rollback to any point in training history, crucial for recovery and auditability.
- **Differential State Synchronization (DSS):**
  - Clients transmit only the *changes* (deltas) to the model parameters rather than full models. This significantly reduces communication overhead, especially important when updates are expanded by DP noise.
- **Adaptive Role Reassignment Protocol (ARRP):**
  - A dynamic protocol that enables eligible client devices to temporarily assume coordination duties if the central server fails, ensuring uninterrupted training progression.
- **Zero-Knowledge Integrity Proofs (ZKIP):**
  - Cryptographic proofs accompanying model updates (including noisy, differentially private deltas) and recovered states, allowing verification of their integrity and origin without revealing the sensitive data or the exact model parameters. This enhances verifiability for **Regulatory Compliance**.
- **Entropy-Based Corruption Detection (EBCD):**
  - Utilizes principles from **Information Theory** (e.g., monitoring statistical moments like variance, skewness, kurtosis of model parameters) to identify potentially corrupted or anomalous model updates, even in the presence of DP noise, by establishing dynamic baselines.

## Methodology Details
In DP-RTFL, each client trains a local model on its data shard (e.g., a subset of credit application and record data). The client computes model parameter deltas using DSS. These deltas are then privatized via LDP (clipping and noise addition). The noisy, differentially private deltas, along with their ZKIPs, are sent to the current coordinator (server or ARRP-elected client). The coordinator verifies proofs, aggregates the valid noisy deltas (e.g., using Federated Averaging), and applies the aggregated update to the global model. EBCD monitors the global model for anomalies. TCM records all global states, client update summaries (including DP parameters like ε, δ, and clipping bound used for the round), and coordinator actions, providing a comprehensive audit trail. The system is designed to be validated within an **"Enterprise-grade testing environment"** to simulate real-world failure modes and recovery paths with the specified financial datasets.
